Picking Tickets

Consider an array of n ticket prices, tickets. A number, m, is defined as the size of some subsequence, s, of
tickets where each element covers and un broken range of integers. That is to say, if you were to sort the elements in s, 
the absolute difference between any elements j and j + 1 would be either 0 or 1. Determine the maximum length of a sequence chosen from the tickets array.

Example
tickets = [8, 5, 4, 8, 4]

Valid subsequences, sorted, are {4, 4, 5} and {8, 8}. These subsequences have m values of 3 and 2, respectively, 
Return 3.
